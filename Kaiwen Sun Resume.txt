Key Coursework and Projects																	
- Distributed File System
	- Use self-implemented general-purpose Java RMI library for remote process communication.
	- Java skills include dynamic proxy, reflection, and multithreads synchronized by read/write lock.
- Remote Shell Controller
	- An integration of multiprogramming remote terminals like SSH, but has features catering my personal usage.
	- Client and server’s roles are swapped, so that controller can access to computers hidden behind NAT router.
- Virtual Machine Management Cloud    (funding from Nanjing Univ. Undergraduate Innovation Program)
	- Led a four-member team to design and implement a VM cloud, through which users can create, use, migrate and delete personalized operating system running on distant servers. Coded mainly in C.
- Some Neural Network Projects
	- A multi-layer neural network trained by back-propagation, using MATLAB, to learn and test on the MNIST Dataset.
	- A convolutional neural network, using Berkeley Caffe and AWS, to train and test on the CIFAR-100 Dataset.
	- A face verification program using DeepID proposed by CUHK scholars. Convolutional network and Siamese network are used.
- Some Computer Vision Projects
	- A sparse stereo matching program, using corner detection, SSD matching, and Epipolar Geometry.
	- An image warping program using homography. Convert any quadrangle in a photo to get its front view.
	- A program detecting optical flow
	- Two human face classifiers using eigenfaces and Fisherfaces
- Simplified Unix-like Operating System
	- Built and coded operating system with I/O, process switching, file system, memory allocation features.
- “C-- Compiler”
	- Designed and built a compiler with Linux C to check errors and translate simplified C files to MIPS code
	- Optimization power of the compiler ranked among top 5% in the class
- Program Recognizing Handwritten Chinese Characters	
	- Designed the recognition algorithm, which was simple but effective. Implemented using MFC
- Boolean SAT Problem Solution Based on DPLL and Probability
	- Achieved full marks in this course, due to this fastest algorithm in my class.
- Single Cycle CPU and Multiple Cycle CPU
	- Design notes included by the lecturer in handouts for future terms. Coded in hardware language Verilog.

Scholarships and Honors
